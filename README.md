### Users Table
- Columns: id (Primary Key), username, email, password_hash (hashed password), etc.

### Categories Table

### Orders Table

## Relationships
- Each user can have multiple carts, but only one active cart at a time.
- Each cart can have multiple cart items.
- Each user can place multiple orders.
- Each order can have multiple order items.

## Authentication
- Upon registration, user information is stored in the Users table.
- Authentication is handled through JWT tokens.
- Users can register and authenticate via the `/register` and `/login` endpoints.

## Endpoints

### Public Endpoints
- `/register`: Register a new user.
- `/login`: Authenticate a user and generate a JWT token.

### Protected Endpoints
- `/categories`: Retrieve a list of categories.
- `/categories/{category_id}/products`: Retrieve products based on category ID.
- `/products/{product_id}`: Retrieve detailed information about a product by its ID.
- `/cart`: View the current user's cart.
- `/cart/add/:productid`: Add a product to the current user's cart.
- `/cart/update`: Update the quantity of a product in the current user's cart.
- `/cart/remove`: Remove a product from the current user's cart.
- `/order/place`: Place an order with products from the user's cart.
- `/order/history`: Retrieve the order history for the current user.
- `/order/{order_id}`: Retrieve detailed information about a specific order by its ID.

### Meta Endpoint
- `/createproducts`: Meta endpoint to create products for testing purposes.

## Usage
